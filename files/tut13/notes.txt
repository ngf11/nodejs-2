authotication vs. Authorization 

They are offten used interchangably or simply as "auth"
But they are not the same thing.
--authotication:
refers to the process of verifying  who someone is 

--Authorization:
is the process verifying what resourses a user has access to 

when we login with username and password we are verifying who we are and that is consider to be authotication

after login in our express api issues user JWT tokens.
JWTs = Json web tokens 
>confirms authotication
>Allow access to API endpoints
>endpoints provide data resourses
>Use Authorization header
----------
here we are going to expand the user the user authotication process by 
adding user rolls with spesific permissions to our api authotication
process
--User rolls and permissions
> provide diferent levels of access 
> sent in access token payload
>Verified with Middleware
