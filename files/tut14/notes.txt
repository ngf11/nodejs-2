--MongoDB and Mongoose--
 MongoDB is the data base in the MERN stack  "M"
 the fontend is handel by React

 Traditonal SQL databases are built  in a relational structure 
 relational tables referenc eachother with joins as data is query
 these relational tables also normalize the data means data is not duplicated in the tables  thats the "D.R.Y" princeple  "Don't repat yourself" and thats is apply to the structure 

 however with NOsql databases you can thorw all of that out.

 MongoDB stores data in colections 
 the indivitual reacord in collections are called documents 
 the documents have key value structure and look alot like json 

 A collections holds all of the data about a user for example insted of breaking into related tables and likewise duplicating and distrubuting the data where deemed necessary in a NOsql structure is permieted 

 So why chooes NOsql databases??
 Advatages:
 -Peformance - is key. The speed that a colection is queried is very fast
 - Flexability - its very easy to make structual changes. Like adding a new feild with out wreaking havoc. Is much like adding a new property to an object.
- scalability - it can suport large databases with high request rates at a very low latency 
-usablity - we can get up an running with mongoldb very fast
